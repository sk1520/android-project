This project is an MTA utility app that helps people who rely on MTA with various things such as getting service status of the trains they commute on.\
The files displayed are all xml, and Java classes that we created in Android Studios.

This was a project and isn't and official app that has been released. This app has been developed by my peer Ryan and myself.
